 * Responses where {@link Response#status()} is not in the 2xx range are

 * certain RPC apis return errors defined in the {@link Response#body()} even on
 * a 200 status. For example, in the DynECT api, a job still running condition
 * is returned with a 200 status, encoded in json. When scenarios like this
 * occur, you should raise an application-specific exception (which may be
 * {@link feign.RetryableException retryable}).
